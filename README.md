Polygon-Based Graph Visualization (GPU Version)

This project provides a GPU-accelerated method to visualize graphs using polygonal regions. Below is a detailed guide for installation and execution.

üîß Installation

Note: This project must be run on Linux and requires CUDA to be installed on your system.

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Ehsan486/PolygonBasedGraphVisualization.git
cd PolygonBasedGraphVisualization

Install CUDA (if not already installed)

Make sure CUDA is installed and configured correctly for your GPU. You can check with:

nvcc --version

Follow the official CUDA installation guide if needed.

Build the GPU-based Code

Navigate to the build directory and compile the project:

cd build/linux
make graph_viewer

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Program

After successful compilation, you can run the program using a command like:

./graph_viewer ./paper/our3/small_graph_size_10_graph_1/outputs_convert/Vpolygon_points.txt ./paper/our3/small_graph_size_10_graph_1/outputs_convert/edgelist.txt ./paper/our3/small_graph_size_10_graph_1 2000 1 wg 1 1 approximate 1 1 1 png svg gpu 1866 ./paper/our3/small_graph_size_10_graph_1/outputs_convert/node_polygon_mapping.txt \

üìÇ Input Files

Vpolygon_points.txt

Each line represents a polygon using the format:

<polygon_id> x1,y1 x2,y2 x3,y3 ... xn,yn

Example:

0 0.0,0.0 1.0,0.0 1.0,1.0 0.0,1.0
1 2.0,2.0 3.0,2.0 3.0,3.0 2.0,3.0

edgelist.txt

Contains the list of edges, one per line:

<source_node_id> <target_node_id>

Example:

0 1
1 2
2 3
3 0

node_polygon_mapping.txt

Maps node IDs to polygon IDs:

<polygon_id> <node_id_1> <node_id_2> ... <node_id_n>

Example:

0 0 1
1 2 3

üñºÔ∏è Output

The program generates layout visualizations in the specified formats (png, svg) and saves them in a timestamped directory within the output path.

üîç Reproducing Figure 1 (GI 2025 Paper)

To recreate Figure 1 from our paper "Map Visualizations for Graphs with Group Restrictions" presented at GI 2025, follow these steps:

Download the example input files:

edgelist.txt ‚Äì network edge list

node_polygon_mapping.txt ‚Äì node-to-polygon mapping

Vpolygon_points.txt ‚Äì polygon shapes (not uploaded yet, please include this in your repo)

Run the following command:

./graph_viewer \
  ./Vpolygon_points.txt \
  ./edgelist.txt \
  ./output \
  2000 1 wg 1 1 approximate 1 1 \
  1 1 png svg gpu 3000 \
  ./node_polygon_mapping.txt \
  0.7 1 1 \
  ./polygon/default_node_map_dep_map.txt \
  ./polygon/default_node_map_dep_map.txt

View the Result:

The output will be saved as an SVG and PNG under ./output/.

Example results are shown below:




üìå Notes

The layout engine uses GPU-accelerated ForceAtlas2, tuned for subgraph fitting within polygon boundaries.

The program dynamically adjusts scaling to minimize area difference between graph convex hulls and polygon shapes.

Corner gravity helps stretch layouts to better fit polygon shapes, improving aesthetic results.
