üìÇ Input Files

Vpolygon\_points.txt

Each line represents a polygon using the format:

\<polygon\_id\> x1,y1 x2,y2 x3,y3 ... xn,yn

Example:

0 0.0,0.0 1.0,0.0 1.0,1.0 0.0,1.0 1 2.0,2.0 3.0,2.0 3.0,3.0 2.0,3.0

edgelist.txt

Contains the list of edges, one per line:

\<source\_node\_id\> \<target\_node\_id\>

Example:

0 1 1 2 2 3 3 0

node\_polygon\_mapping.txt

Maps node IDs to polygon IDs:

\<polygon\_id\> \<node\_id\_1\> \<node\_id\_2\> ... \<node\_id\_n\>

Example:

0 0 1 1 2 3

üñºÔ∏è Output

The program generates layout visualizations in the specified formats (png, svg) and saves them in a timestamped directory within the output path.

üîç Reproducing Figure 1 (GI 2025 Paper)

To recreate Figure 1 from our paper "Map Visualizations for Graphs with Group Restrictions" presented at GI 2025, follow these steps:

Unzip ‚Äúbuilds.zip‚Äù

Use the following files found in paper/our2/dlpb\_small/outputs\_convert:

polyline\_points.txt

edgelist.txt ‚Äì network edge list

node\_polygon\_mapping.txt ‚Äì node-to-polygon mapping

The full path to these files can be used, or move them into builds/linux.

Navigate to builds/linux and run the following command:

./graph\_viewer ./paper/our2/dlpb\_small/outputs\_convert/polyline\_point.txt ./paper/our2/dlpb\_small/outputs\_convert/edgelist.txt ./paper/our2/dlpb\_small 2000 1 wg 1 1 approximate 1 1 1 png svg gpu 26325 ./paper/our2/dlpb\_small/outputs\_convert/node\_polygon\_mapping.txt .7 1 1 ./polygon/default\_node\_map\_dep\_map.txt ./polygon/default\_node\_map\_dep\_map.txt 

View the Result:

The output will be saved as an SVG and PNG under ./output/.

Example results are shown below:

üìå Notes

The layout engine uses GPU-accelerated ForceAtlas2, tuned for subgraph fitting within polygon boundaries.

The program dynamically adjusts scaling to minimize area difference between graph convex hulls and polygon shapes.

Corner gravity helps stretch layouts to better fit polygon shapes, improving aesthetic results.
